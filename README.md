# VCPI

Computer vision and image processing ( Vis√£o por computador e processamento de imagem)

This github repository contains two main folders, the first one contains the individual project and the second the first group project of the subject.

## VCPI_Individual

This project was developed within the scope of the VCPI course, where it was proposed to each student to explore a GAN or autoencoder model in a problem of the student's choice. Thefore, this project notebook aims to transform comic book covers into Van Gogh paintings and vice versa, using the CycleGAN model.
All results and process are documented and can be seen in the jupyter notebook.

## VCPI_Project1

Project1 was the first project that was developed in a group within the scope of the VCPI discipline. This project aimed to apply a series of filters and image processing techniques to a distorted image, in order to create an algorithm that correctly detects the correct number of circles in the image. The project results and process can be consulted in the jupyter notebook _CountCircles.ipynb_
